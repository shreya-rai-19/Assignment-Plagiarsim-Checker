    <font color ="#660066"><p class = "text-xl px-1 py-3 w-1/3 ">Our Journey </p></font>

    <p>We knew the gaps and issues in academic writing like how it can be exploited and how the existing technology was lacking in areas. From that stemmed the creation of Plagiarism Checker X in 2012.

    Ever since, we have strived to deliver a plagiarism detector that is not only quick in its scanning but also actually effective, accurate, safe, easy to use and meets the needs of the users.
    
    The lack of accessibility and the need of institutional licenses limited students and professionals. We fixed it by removing barriers of affordability and access through the option of a free plagiarism checker as well with the same quality of plagiarism detection and data security. In the last decade, we are proud of our achievements like the 1M+ downloads and having our users all over the world across more than 100 countries.</p>
